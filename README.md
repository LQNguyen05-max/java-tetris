Exercise 1.6 – Java Graphics Program
📖 Description

This project is a solution to Exercise 1.6 from the textbook (pages 27–28). The task involves writing a Java program that:

Draws all components shown in the figure from the textbook (rectangles, shapes, or text as required).

The positions do not need to be pixel-perfect but should resemble the figure.

Interactive Behavior:

When the mouse cursor moves inside the main drawing area, the text “PAUSE” (in a large font) will be displayed.

When the mouse cursor moves outside the drawing area, the word “PAUSE” will disappear.

This demonstrates basic graphics drawing and mouse event handling in Java.

🛠️ Features

Custom drawing of shapes and text using Java Swing/Graphics.

Real-time detection of mouse cursor position.

Conditional rendering of the “PAUSE” message.
